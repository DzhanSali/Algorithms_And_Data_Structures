# Algorithms_And_Data_Structures

The following project represents exercises done for an Algorithms and Data Structures course at uni.

Some may notice that the layout, or say, the way that the project and its files are organised is neither typical nor ordinary.
Nevertheless, I must bring to your attention the fact that this layout (in particular the class named "ExercisesADS") was explicitly requested to be in the form
that it is presently.

There are three classes named Exercise(One - Three) which are later merged into one file. This creates problem with the Main methods in the project that are fighting 
between themselves which one should go first and be executed. There are also other errors which I am aware of, but are caused by the very design/structure of the project
and its respective files/classes. Again, this is intentional.

Contents:

=> In file named "ExerciseOne":
Two lists with numbers from user input are united or have intersection applied onto them.

=> In file named "ExerciseTwo":
Sequence of numbers are entered into the program by a user. If there is a number entered more than once, there is a message stating how many times it is present in the 
sequence. At the end a list with max values from the aforementioned sequence is shown.

=> In file named "ExerciseThree": 
A list with numbers from user input returns a new list with positive numbers only.
